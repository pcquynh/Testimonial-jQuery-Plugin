Testimonial Display jQuery Plugin
This plugin is used to display slide show of different testimonials automatically or manually with an image, a feedback text, a name, and a rating. It also provides option to the users to modify some css properties or interval time.

1.	How does it work?

•	Each testimonial will contain an image, which will be displayed in one circle, a feedback text, a name, and rating (stars are shown, maximum 5 stars), which are shown under the image. 

•	Each testimonial will slide automatically (animation will be defined lately) until the last testimonial and the slide show will repeat. The interval time can be used as default or set by user.

•	Besides, there are buttons to move forward or go back if users want to control manually. 

•	Also, this plugin allows users to stop at one desired testimonial. 

•	Some css properties such as font-size, image width, image height, color, etc. can be used as default or set by user.

2.	What would be needed to install?

•	Users need to install a script file that contains the plugin function. 

•	.css files need to be installed as well.
